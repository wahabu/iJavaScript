# DOM ClassList Basics

This is a small practice project focused on JavaScript fundamentals.

## Purpose

Practice basic DOM manipulation using vanilla JavaScript:

- Selecting elements from the DOM
- Handling simple user interactions
- Toggling and removing CSS classes dynamically

## What this project demonstrates

- `document.querySelector`
- `classList.toggle()`
- `classList.remove()`
- Using inline event handlers (`onclick`)
- Separating structure (HTML), style (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript)

## How it works

- Buttons trigger JavaScript functions
- Each function adds or removes a CSS class
- CSS classes control text appearance (bold, italic, underline, monospace)
- A reset button removes all applied styles

## Why this project exists

This project is intentionally simple.
It is meant for learning and reviewing JavaScript basics,
not for building a production-ready application.

## Notes to self

- Focus is on understanding DOM and class manipulation
- No frameworks, no libraries, no advanced patterns
- This is a foundation block for future JavaScript learning
