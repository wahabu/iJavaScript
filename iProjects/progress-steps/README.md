# Progress Steps

This is a front-end practice project built to strengthen my foundation in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The component visually demonstrates step-by-step progress using dynamic UI updates and interactive buttons.

The goal of this project was to:

- Rebuild my fundamentals through practical coding
- Improve my workflow and structure in small front-end tasks
- Understand event handling and DOM manipulation
- Practice clean CSS and responsive UI layout
- Train myself to finish mini-projects end-to-end
- Develop a better sense of how modern AI coding tools interpret and assist with front-end code

This project is intentionally simple, but it represents a complete practice cycle:
**Write → Test → Fix → Improve → Finalize.**

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (DOM, events, dynamic styling)**

---

## ✨ Features

- Clean and minimal UI
- Step-by-step progress bar with active/inactive states
- Smooth CSS transitions
- “Next” and “Prev” button controls
- Fully functional JavaScript logic to update progress dynamically
- Disabled button state handling for UX clarity

## 📌 Project Status

The project is now **complete**.

All core features are working:

- HTML structure ✔
- CSS styling and layout ✔
- JavaScript logic (update cycle, button control, DOM manipulation) ✔

I may add small improvements in the future such as:

- Animations
- More steps
- Mobile enhancements
- Reusable component version
- Conversion to a class-based JavaScript module

## 🧠 Purpose & Learning Outcome

This project is part of my personal journey to:

- Strengthen core front-end fundamentals
- Build consistency through small daily projects
- Prepare myself for more advanced full-stack work
- Improve how I debug, refactor, and organize code
- Understand how AI coding tools analyze and suggest improvements

Rather than focusing on originality, this project focuses on **deliberate practice** to create a reliable coding workflow.
