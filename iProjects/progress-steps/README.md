# Progress Steps

This is a small front-end practice project built to sharpen my fundamentals in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

The goal of this project is simple:

- Learn how to implement progress steps from scratch
- Practice clean structure and workflow
- Improve my JavaScript fundamentals through hands-on coding
- Build the habit of finishing small, focused projects to strengthen my development skills

This project is intentionally minimal.  
It is part of my journey to rebuild my foundation, improve consistency, and master the core building blocks of front-end development.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Progress Steps logic)

## Status

HTML and CSS are completed.  
JavaScript functionality will be added next.

## Purpose

This project is not meant to be unique or original.  
It is a **deliberate practice** exercise to improve workflow, reinforce fundamentals, and prepare for more advanced full-stack projects.

## Future Improvements

- Add JavaScript logic for step progression
- Add animations and better UI transitions
- Make the component reusable for future projects
