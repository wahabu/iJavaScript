# Rotating Navigation Animation

This is a front-end practice project built to improve my understanding of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** through a rotating navigation UI effect.

The goal of this project is to:

- Practice creating interactive navigation using CSS transforms and transitions
- Work with JavaScript to toggle classes and control UI state
- Strengthen my front-end workflow by following a small, focused project
- Build a reusable pattern for future UI animations and layouts

This project is intentionally simple and based on a classic "Rotating Navigation" example from a JavaScript course.
It is part of my ongoing practice to finish mini-projects and refine my core skills.
